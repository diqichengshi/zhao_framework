package org.springframework.web.servlet;

/**
 * Central dispatcher for HTTP request handlers/controllers, e.g. for web UI controllers
 * or HTTP-based remote service exporters. Dispatches to registered handlers for processing
 * a web request, providing convenient mapping and exception handling facilities.
 *
 * <p>This servlet is very flexible: It can be used with just about any workflow, with the
 * installation of the appropriate adapter classes. It offers the following functionality
 * that distinguishes it from other request-driven web MVC frameworks:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is based around a JavaBeans configuration mechanism.
 *
 * <li>It can use any {@link HandlerMapping} implementation - pre-built or provided as part
 * of an application - to control the routing of requests to handler objects. Default is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping} and
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping}.
 * HandlerMapping objects can be defined as beans in the servlet's application context,
 * implementing the HandlerMapping interface, overriding the default HandlerMapping if
 * present. HandlerMappings can be given any bean name (they are tested by type).
 *
 * <li>It can use any {@link HandlerAdapter}; this allows for using any handler interface.
 * Default adapters are {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.HttpRequestHandlerAdapter},
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter}, for Spring's
 * {@link org.springframework.web.HttpRequestHandler} and
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller} interfaces, respectively. A default
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter}
 * will be registered as well. HandlerAdapter objects can be added as beans in the
 * application context, overriding the default HandlerAdapters. Like HandlerMappings,
 * HandlerAdapters can be given any bean name (they are tested by type).
 *
 * <li>The dispatcher's exception resolution strategy can be specified via a
 * {@link HandlerExceptionResolver}, for example mapping certain exceptions to error pages.
 * Default are
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver},
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.ResponseStatusExceptionResolver}, and
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver}.
 * These HandlerExceptionResolvers can be overridden through the application context.
 * HandlerExceptionResolver can be given any bean name (they are tested by type).
 *
 * <li>Its view resolution strategy can be specified via a {@link ViewResolver}
 * implementation, resolving symbolic view names into View objects. Default is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver}.
 * ViewResolver objects can be added as beans in the application context, overriding the
 * default ViewResolver. ViewResolvers can be given any bean name (they are tested by type).
 *
 * <li>If a {@link View} or view name is not supplied by the user, then the configured
 * {@link RequestToViewNameTranslator} will translate the current request into a view name.
 * The corresponding bean name is "viewNameTranslator"; the default is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.view.DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator}.
 *
 * <li>The dispatcher's strategy for resolving multipart requests is determined by a
 * {@link org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartResolver} implementation.
 * Implementations for Apache Commons FileUpload and Servlet 3 are included; the typical
 * choice is {@link org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver}.
 * The MultipartResolver bean name is "multipartResolver"; default is none.
 *
 * <li>Its locale resolution strategy is determined by a {@link LocaleResolver}.
 * Out-of-the-box implementations work via HTTP accept header, cookie, or session.
 * The LocaleResolver bean name is "localeResolver"; default is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver}.
 *
 * <li>Its theme resolution strategy is determined by a {@link ThemeResolver}.
 * Implementations for a fixed theme and for cookie and session storage are included.
 * The ThemeResolver bean name is "themeResolver"; default is
 * {@link org.springframework.web.servlet.theme.FixedThemeResolver}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE: The {@code @RequestMapping} annotation will only be processed if a
 * corresponding {@code HandlerMapping} (for type-level annotations) and/or
 * {@code HandlerAdapter} (for method-level annotations) is present in the dispatcher.</b>
 * This is the case by default. However, if you are defining custom {@code HandlerMappings}
 * or {@code HandlerAdapters}, then you need to make sure that a corresponding custom
 * {@code DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping} and/or {@code AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter}
 * is defined as well - provided that you intend to use {@code @RequestMapping}.
 *
 * <p><b>A web application can define any number of DispatcherServlets.</b>
 * Each servlet will operate in its own namespace, loading its own application context
 * with mappings, handlers, etc. Only the root application context as loaded by
 * {@link org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener}, if any, will be shared.
 *
 * <p>As of Spring 3.1, {@code DispatcherServlet} may now be injected with a web
 * application context, rather than creating its own internally. This is useful in Servlet
 * 3.0+ environments, which support programmatic registration of servlet instances.
 * See the {@link #DispatcherServlet(WebApplicationContext)} javadoc for details.
